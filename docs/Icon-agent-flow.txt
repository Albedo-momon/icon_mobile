In-House (agent visits user’s home/office)
In-Shop (user comes to shop for repair/diagnosis)
PC Build (special sub-flow of In-Shop)
🌐
 Theoretical Explanation of the Three Flows
1. In-House Flow (Agent goes to user’s home/office)
Booking options
: “At My Place” or “On-Site” (better copy than “IN HOUSE”).
User app lifecycle
:
Request Raised
Searching for agent
Request sent → shows agent name once assigned
Waiting for agent to approve
Agent accepted
ETA confirmed (agent provides ETA)
Diagnosis Pending (user sees “Agent is on the way”)
Diagnosis Started (agent presses start)
Diagnosis Completed (agent logs findings + expected time)
Repair 
In
 Progress
Completed or Cancelled
Agent app lifecycle
:
Gets request → Accept/Reject
Provides ETA (after accept)
Diagnosis Started → Diagnosis Completed (choose predefined issues or enter custom)
Enter estimated resolution time
Repair 
In
 Progress → mark as Completed
Admin dashboard view
:
Sees full audit of request → accepted, ETA, diagnosis, progress, completion.
Can override status (force cancel or reassign).
2. In-Shop Flow (User comes to the shop for repair/diagnosis)
Booking options
: “At the Shop” or “Walk-In”.
User app lifecycle
:
Request Raised
Searching for agent
Request sent → shows agent name once assigned
Waiting for agent to approve
Agent accepted
Diagnosis Started (no “Reached” step, since user is already in shop)
Diagnosis Completed (agent selects predefined issue or enters custom + estimated time)
Repair 
In
 Progress
Completed or Cancelled
Agent app lifecycle
:
Gets request → Accept/Reject
Immediately starts Diagnosis
Logs findings, selects estimated time
Moves to Repair 
In
 Progress
Completes when done
Admin dashboard view
:
Sees “Walk-In” requests separately
Same tracking as In-House minus ETA/Reaching
3. PC Build Flow (Special flow under In-Shop)
Booking option
: “Custom PC Build”
User app lifecycle
:
Request Raised
Searching for agent
Request sent → agent assigned
Waiting for agent to approve
Agent accepted
Build 
In
 Progress
Build Complete → Software Installation 
In
 Progress
Installation Done → Testing & QA
Testing Done → Completed
Agent app lifecycle
:
Accept/Reject job
Enter expected build duration
Build 
In
 Progress
When assembly finished → press 
Build Done
Software Installation 
In
 Progress
 → mark 
Installation Done
Testing & QA
 → mark 
Testing Done
Finally
 → 
Completed
Admin dashboard view
:
Sees each build phase clearly (Build / Installation / QA).
Can step in if build stalls.
Useful for metrics (average build time, step breakdown).
