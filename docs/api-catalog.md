# API Catalog

A living index of endpoints. Update this file whenever you add or change an endpoint.

| Endpoint | Doc File | Purpose | Data Sources |
|---------|----------|---------|--------------|
| (none yet) | — | — | — |

## How to Update
- Add a row per endpoint, using the exact doc filename under `docs/apis/`.
- Keep Purpose concise (what the API is used for in the app).
- List Data Sources (e.g., mock file, external service, database table).
